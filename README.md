# Cpp_Leetcode

Things I learnt from LeetCode:

1) O(N) Sol also means two or three seperate loops allowed!! since O(2N) = O(N).

2) Test corner cases: like null input, all zero, negative, same values, overflow, etc.

3) For space complexity Dont sweat the small variables like pointers and int etc. Because they are constants, they can be ignored.

4) If you need to do an operation on two data containers, and iterate both, see if you can do just one operation and increment just one container per loop. Makes things simple and reduces duplicate code.
